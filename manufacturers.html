                <p>In 1993 a brief encounter with a piece of ‘recycled paper’ led them on a journey that would give rise
                    to what was at that time a whole new industry in the country. The paper originated in a factory in
                    Pannala, one of only two in the country that was making recycled paper. Due to multiple issues the
                    factory staff had left and operations were at a standstill. Taking over the factory they built a
                    whole
                    new team and added new products and processes to the production cycle – creating paper using waste
                    from paddy, banana and pineapple cultivations as well as waste paper and elephant dung. <br>
                    The original factory is not part of the business anymore; instead they work with multiple smaller
                    manufacturers from whom they source the paper for their products. Their product portfolio itself has
                    evolved to cover a wide range of value added products using multiple mediums from paper to fabric to
                    wood. They source a range of embellishments and outsource a variety of handcrafted work to small
                    suppliers with final assembly, customization and most importantly quality control being carried out
                    at their factory and workshop in Colombo.

                <p>It all began over a game of pool when two individuals identified opportunity in the plastic film
                    industry way back in 1996. This passion was invigorating that both these individuals left their
                    lucrative careers and committed career suicide in an industry they both knew nothing about. This was
                    the beginning of the Polydime journey in 1998. From humble beginnings the organization
                    commenced operations as a polythene trading company. With just two members on staff, a second hand
                    extruder installed in a de-commissioned tile factory and a loan shark’s capital of Rs. 500,000/-
                    began the Polydime journey. <br>
                    The Polydime group is a family owned establishment associated with the Plastics industry for over 2
                    decades. The company has a diverse portfolio of 6 product groups processed in three factories in Sri
                    Lanka and one in India. Employing over 600 staff, servicing the local market and export to 35
                    countries both directly and indirectly. Polydime is the largest processor of recycled plastic with
                    the full value chain from waste collection to end product processing and distribution. The company
                    has its own innovation center for product development with the future in mind.
